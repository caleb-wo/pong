# Overview

I wrote pong in Odin. The main reason I did this is that I have always been intrigued with it as a programming language. It was such a fun project and I enjoyed every step of the way. I had the chance to use Odin's vendor library and had access to RayLib.

Using RayLib, I was able to get pong up and running. Throughout this project, I've realized the strength of Odin being interoperable with C. I have access to so many incredble libraries that have been implemented with C, while also have the power and convenience of programming in Odin.

# Development Environment

I used just Odin and it's core libraries (math, strings, etc.) and RayLib. Aside from that, everything is vanilla odin.
